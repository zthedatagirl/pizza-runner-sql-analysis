--Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? 
--Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza 
--with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

--I would update the existing tables by using an insert statement

INSERT INTO pizza_names
  ("pizza_id", "pizza_name")
VALUES
  (3, 'Supreme')

  
SELECT *
FROM pizza_names


INSERT INTO pizza_recipes
("pizza_id", "toppings")
VALUES
  (3, '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12')


SELECT pn.pizza_id, pizza_name, toppings
FROM pizza_names AS pn
JOIN pizza_recipes AS pr
ON pn.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id
