--INGREDIENT OPTIMIZATION

--1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
SELECT TOP 2 pizza_id,  CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 'Meatlovers' ELSE 'Vegetarian' END AS pizza_name, 
								CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1
								THEN 'Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami' 
								ELSE 'Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes' END AS standard_ingredient
FROM pizza_toppings AS t
FULL OUTER JOIN pizza_recipes AS r
ON t.topping_id = r.pizza_id

--2. What was the most commonly added extra?
SELECT topping_name
FROM (SELECT TOP 1 extras, COUNT(*) No_of_extras
FROM #temp_customer_orders
GROUP BY extras
HAVING extras <> ' '
ORDER BY extras DESC)sub
LEFT JOIN pizza_toppings AS pt
ON sub.No_of_extras = pt.topping_id
WHERE No_of_extras IS NOT NULL

--3. What was the most common exclusion?
SELECT topping_name
FROM (SELECT TOP 1 exclusions, COUNT(*) No_of_exclusions
FROM #temp_customer_orders
GROUP BY exclusions
HAVING exclusions <> ' '
ORDER BY exclusions DESC)sub
FULL OUTER JOIN pizza_toppings AS pt
ON sub.No_of_exclusions = pt.topping_id
WHERE No_of_exclusions IS NOT NULL
 
--4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
--Meat Lovers
--Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
--Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
--Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers
SELECT order_id, customer_id, pn.pizza_id, exclusions, extras, order_time, pizza_name,
		CASE WHEN co.pizza_id = 1 AND co.exclusions = ' ' AND co.extras = ' ' THEN 'Meat lovers'
			 WHEN co.pizza_id = 2 AND co.exclusions = ' ' AND co.extras = ' ' THEN 'Vegetarian'
			 WHEN co.pizza_id = 1 AND co.exclusions = '4' AND co.extras = ' ' THEN 'Meat lovers - Exclude Beef'
			 WHEN co.pizza_id = 2 AND co.exclusions = '4' AND co.extras = ' ' THEN 'Vegetarian - Exclude Beef'
			 WHEN co.pizza_id = 1 AND co.exclusions = ' ' AND co.extras = '1' THEN 'Meat lovers - Extra Bacon'
			 WHEN co.pizza_id = 2 AND co.exclusions = ' ' AND co.extras = '1' THEN 'Vegetarian - Extra Bacon'
			 WHEN co.pizza_id = 1 AND co.exclusions = '4' AND co.extras = '1, 5' THEN 'Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers' 
			 WHEN co.pizza_id = 1 AND co.exclusions = '2, 6' AND co.extras = '1, 4' THEN 'Meat Lovers - Exclude BBQ Sauce and Mushroom - Extra Bacon and Cheese'
			  ELSE 'Vegetarian' END AS Order_item
FROM #temp_customer_orders AS co
JOIN pizza_names AS pn
ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id

--5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
--For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"

SELECT order_id, customer_id, pizza_id, exclusions, extras, order_time,
		CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 'Meat Lovers: Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushroom, Pepperoni, Salami'
			ELSE 'Vegetarians: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomatoes, Tomato Sauce' END AS Ingredient_list
FROM #temp_customer_orders
